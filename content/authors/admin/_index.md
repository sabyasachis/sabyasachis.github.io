I am a Ph.D. candidate at Mila/Université Laval and affiliated to Inria and IID. I am fortunate to be advised by [Christian Gagné](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~cgagne/) and [Frédéric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso/).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I work on understanding and improving generalization and robustness of machine learning models. I am also interested in improving test-time capabilities of foundation models, akin to [o1](https://github.com/srush/awesome-o1/?tab=readme-ov-file) models. I dabbled in generative modelling before it was cool and deployed my research in applications like self-driving cars and medical imaging. For a comprehensive overview of my work, please refer to my [CV](uploads/resume.pdf).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Previously, I was a Research Associate at the ML Lab, IISc Bangalore, under the guidance of [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/). Before that, I worked with the NLP team at [Donut Research Labs](https://www.icecreamlabs.com/) and the self-driving team at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/).
