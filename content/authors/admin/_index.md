I am a PhD candidate at Mila/Université Laval, affiliated with Inria and IID, advised by [Christian Gagné](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~cgagne/) and [Frédéric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso/).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

My research centers on reasoning, generalization, robustness, and efficient adaptation of foundation models, with a particular focus on making large models work reliably on new tasks and realistic compute/data budgets. I am currently a ServiceNow intern, where I am working on fine-tuning vision-language models for web agents. Previously, during my Amazon internship, I worked on improving LLM fine-tuning for reasoning-based tasks. During my PhD, I have explored layer selection for test-time adaptation, out-of-distribution detection, zero-shot CLIP adaptation, and adversarial robustness.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Prior to my PhD, I worked on self-driving at NVIDIA, NLP for e-commerce at Donut Research Labs, and machine learning for robotics and medical imaging as a Research Associate at IISc Bangalore. These experiences shaped my current interest in bridging rigorous ML research with real-world, safety-critical applications.
