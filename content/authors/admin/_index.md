I am a Ph.D. candidate at Mila, IID and Université Laval. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Christian Gagné](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~cgagne/), Mila, IID, Université Laval and [Prof. Frédéric Precioso](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~precioso/), INRIA, Université Côte d'Azur.

I am interested in building robust machine learning systems for real world deployment. Currently, I work on test time adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization and online finetuning. I also actively collaborate on out-of-distribution detection, adversarial robustness, continual learning, foundation models, model explainability, autonomous navigation, and AI in healthcare. For more information, check out my [CV](uploads/resume.pdf).
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Previously, I was Research Associate in ML Lab, IISc Bangalore, under [Prof. Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/).  Prior to this, I have worked as DL Engineer at [Donut Research Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/icecreamlabs) and was part of self-driving software team at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/), Bangalore.
